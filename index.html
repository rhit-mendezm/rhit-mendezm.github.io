          I'm currently pursuing my <strong>Bachelor's of Science in Software Engineering at Rose-Hulman
          Institute of Technology</strong>, where I've developed a strong foundation in software development
          and maintenance. So far, my favorite courses at Rose-Hulman are Software Quality Assurance 
          <em>(CSSE 376)</em>, Web Programming <em>(CSSE 280)</em>, and Computer 
          Architecture I <em>(CSSE 232)</em> because they each introduced me to a distinct area
          of software development I have not seen prior to taking the course.
        </p>

        <h3>CSSE 376</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Software Quality Assurance developed my abilities to test my code and communicate progress with a small team.
            In this course, I became familiar with:
            <ul>
              <li>Test-driven and behavior-driven development</li>
              <li>Unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing</li>
              <li>Test coverage and test case design with boundary value analysis</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>CSSE 280</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Web programming introduced me to front-end development entirely. I learned about:
            <ul>
              <li>Prototyping with Figma</li>
              <li>Client and server communication</li>
              <li>Designing and modifying the DOM of a webpage</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <!-- TODO: Add link to Rosie Runner -->
          <!--<li>Check out my final project, <a href="add-page-to-github-repo" target="blank"><em>Rosie Runner</em></a>, an infinite side scrolling game.
            It is a full-stack application that I developed with my peer Rishi Ramesh.-->
        </ul>

        <h3>CSSE 232</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Computer Architecture I revealed to me under-the-hood processes that occur when a machine executes a
            human-readable language. This includes:
            <ul>
              <li>Recognizing data, control, and structural hazards</li>
              <li>Creating a new instruction in the RISC-V architecture</li>
              <li>Understanding the advantages and disadvantages of a pipelined vs. single-cycle processor</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

          I've interned at <a href="https://www.kratosdefense.com"><strong>Kratos Defense & Security Solutions</strong></a> and 
          <a href="https://www.rhventures.org"><strong>Rose-Hulman Ventures</strong></a>, so I have contributed to real world software 
          projects in both defense and medical domains.
        </p>

        <h2>Kratos Defense & Security Solutions</h2>
        <p>
          In the 2025 Summer, I worked at the Academy Ridge View office of Kratos in Colorado Springs, CO. As a Software Architecture Intern,
          I worked to develop middleware involved in satellite communications. Later this summer, I will further detail what I learned from this 
          unique experience!
        </p>
        <!-- TODO: Add to paragraph details of experiences from Kratos; Include using Gitbucket and Jira -->
  
        <h2>Rose-Hulman Ventures</h2>
        <p>
          From February to May of 2025, I worked at Ventures in Terre Haute, IN as a Software Engineering Intern while balancing the responsibilites
          of a full-time Rose-Hulman student. I developed software for a full-stack medical application 
          <a href="https://www.rhventures.org/remote-medication-monitoring-app/"><strong>eRAMx</strong></a> in C# that allowed administrators to virtually 
          certify that patients were following rehabilitation procedures. I joined the team during the migration process from a legacy system, and I 
          began the initiaive for unit testing as we migrated to a modern design.

          Looking ahead, I want to study cybersecurity after I complete my undergraduate studies. Specifically, I want to 
          learn more about cryptography, cyber threat intelligence, and application security.
