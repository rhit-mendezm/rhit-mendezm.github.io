      <h2>üéì Studying Software Engineering at Rose-Hulman</h2>
      <p>
        I'm currently pursuing my
        <strong>
          Bachelor's of Science in Software Engineering at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology
        </strong>
        , where I've developed a strong foundation in software development and maintenance. So far, my favorite courses
        at Rose-Hulman are Software Quality Assurance (CSSE 376), Web Programming (CSSE 280), and Computer Architecture
        I (CSSE 232) because they introduced to a distinct area of software development I have not seen prior to taking
        the course.
      </p>

      <h2>üìû Contact Information</h2>
      <p>
        Feel free to reach out via LinkedIn! You can find my LinkedIn at the footer of each page, and I'm happy to share
        my email and phone number through LinkedIn messages ‚Äî I'm just a bit cautious about posting my contact details
        in such a publicly accessible space.
      </p>

      <h3>CSSE 376</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Software Quality Assurance developed my abilities to test my code and communicate progress with a small team.
          In this course, I became familiar with:
          <ul>
            <li>Test-driven and behavior-driven development</li>
            <li>Unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing</li>
            <li>Test coverage and test case design with boundary value analysis</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>CSSE 280</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Web programming introduced me to front-end development entirely. I learned about:
          <ul>
            <li>Prototyping with Figma</li>
            <li>Client and server communication</li>
            <li>Designing and modifying the DOM of a webpage</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4Bxh8jVLXM" target="_blank">YouTube video</a>
          to see my partner Rishi Ramesh and I present our final project for CSSE 280. We titled our project
          <em>Rosie Runner</em> because it is an infinite side scrolling running game and the player plays as
          our school's mascot - Rosie the Elephant. Here are some details about our project:
          <ul>
            <li>The frontend is served through the Angular framework</li>
            <li>The game was created with the JavaScript <em>Kaplay</em> library</li>
            <li>We support page validation, persistent data storage for user information, and a dynamically updated
              leaderboard</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>CSSE 232</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Computer Architecture I revealed to me under-the-hood processes that occur when a machine executes a
          human-readable language. This includes:
          <ul>
            <li>Recognizing data, control, and structural hazards</li>
            <li>Creating a new instruction in the RISC-V architecture</li>
            <li>Understanding the advantages and disadvantages of a pipelined vs. single-cycle processor</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>üõ°Ô∏èüè• Real-World Experience in Defense & Healthcare</h2>
      <p>
        I've interned at
        <a href="https://www.kratosdefense.com" target="_blank">
          <strong>Kratos Defense & Security Solutions</strong>
        </a>
        and
        <a href="https://www.rhventures.org" target="_blank">
          <strong>Rose-Hulman Ventures</strong>
        </a>
        , so I have contributed to real world software projects in both defense and medical domains.
      </p>

      <h3>Kratos Defense & Security Solutions</h3>
      <p>
        In the 2025 Summer, I worked at the Academy Ridge View office of Kratos in Colorado Springs, CO. As a Software
        Architecture Intern, I worked to develop middleware involved in satellite communications. Later this summer, I
        will further detail what I learned from this unique experience!
      </p>
      <!-- TODO: Add to paragraph details of experiences from Kratos; Include using Gitbucket and Jira -->

      <h3>Rose-Hulman Ventures</h3>
      <p>
        From February to May of 2025, I worked at Ventures in Terre Haute, IN as a Software Engineering Intern while
        balancing the responsibilities of a full-time Rose-Hulman student. I developed software for a full-stack medical
        application
        <a href="https://www.rhventures.org/remote-medication-monitoring-app/" target="_blank">
          <strong>eRAMx</strong>
        </a>
        in C# that allowed administrators to virtually certify that patients were following rehabilitation procedures. I
        joined the team during the migration process from a legacy system, and I began the initiative for unit testing
        as we migrated to a modern design.

      <h2>üîêüëÄ My Next Chapter: Cryptography & Cyber Defense</h2>
      <p>
        Looking ahead, I want to study cybersecurity after I complete my undergraduate studies. Specifically, I'm eager
        to deepen my understanding of cryptography, cyber threat intelligence, and application security‚Äîfields that are
        critical to protecting sensitive data and maintaining trust in digital systems. I'm particularly interested in
        how encryption algorithms safeguard communication, how threat intelligence helps anticipate and mitigate
        attacks, and how secure coding practices can prevent vulnerabilities in software. My goal is to contribute to
        building resilient systems that can withstand evolving cyber threats in both public and private sectors.
