      <h2>üéì Studying Software Engineering at Rose-Hulman</h2>
      <p>
        I'm currently pursuing my
        <strong>Bachelor's of Science in Software Engineering at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology</strong>,
        where I've developed a strong foundation in software development and maintenance, and I will be
        <strong>graduating in May 2026</strong>. So far, my favorite courses at Rose-Hulman are Software Quality
        Assurance, Web Programming, and Computer Architecture I because they introduced
        to a distinct area of software development I have not seen prior to taking the course.

      <h2>üõ°Ô∏èüè• Real-World Experience in Defense & Healthcare</h2>
      <p>
        I've interned at <a href="https://www.kratosdefense.com" target="_blank"><strong>Kratos Defense & Security
            Solutions</strong></a> and
        <a href="https://www.rhventures.org" target="_blank"><strong>Rose-Hulman Ventures</strong></a>, so I have
        contributed to real world software projects in both defense and medical domains.
      </p>

      <h3>Kratos Defense & Security Solutions</h3>
      <p>
        In the 2025 Summer, I worked at the Academy Ridge View office of Kratos in Colorado Springs, CO. As a Software
        Architecture Intern, I worked to develop middleware involved in satellite communications. Later this summer, I
        will further detail what I learned from this unique experience!
      </p>
      <!-- TODO: Add to paragraph details of experiences from Kratos; Include using Gitbucket and Jira -->

      <h3>Rose-Hulman Ventures</h3>
      <p>
        From February to May of 2025, I worked at Ventures in Terre Haute, IN as a Software Engineering Intern while
        balancing the responsibilities of a full-time Rose-Hulman student. I developed software for a full-stack medical
        application <a href="https://www.rhventures.org/remote-medication-monitoring-app/" target="_blank">
          <strong>eRAMx</strong></a> in C# that allowed administrators to virtually certify that patients were following
        rehabilitation procedures. I joined the team during the migration process from a legacy system, and I began the
        initiative for unit testing as we migrated to a modern design.

      <h2>üìö Core Computer Science Coursework: Quality Assurance, Web Development, and Computer Architecture</h2>
      <h3>Software Quality Assurance</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Software Quality Assurance developed my abilities to test my code and communicate progress with a small
          team.
          In this course, I became familiar with:
          <ul>
            <li>Test-driven and behavior-driven development</li>
            <li>Unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing</li>
            <li>Test coverage and test case design with boundary value analysis</li>

      <h3>Web Programming</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Web programming introduced me to front-end development entirely. I learned about:

            <li>Prototyping with Figma</li>
            <li>Client and server communication</li>

          see my partner Rishi Ramesh and I present our final project for CSSE 280. We titled our project
          <em>Rosie Runner</em> because it is an infinite side scrolling running game and the player plays as
          our school's mascot - Rosie the Elephant. Here are some details about our project:
          <ul>
            <li>The frontend is served through the Angular framework</li>
            <li>The game was created with the JavaScript <em>Kaplay</em> library</li>
            <li>
              We support page validation, persistent data storage for user information, and a dynamically updated
              leaderboard

      <h2>üåü Campus Involvement and Mentorship</h2>
      <p>
        Outside of my academic coursework, I am <strong>involved in mentoring and on-campus employment</strong>, and I
        enjoy weightlifting in my free time. As a mentor, I support nine Rose-Hulman students ‚Äî individuals I now
        consider like family. My role involves guiding their personal and professional growth and helping them navigate
        the challenges of college life. I have had the privilege of mentoring through several campus organizations,
        including the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE), RoseBUD, Pi Kappa Alpha (PIKE), and Alpha Phi
        Omega (APO).
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to my involvement with student organizations, I hold several on-campus positions that allow me to
        support both academic and extracurricular communities. I work as a <strong>tutor for the AskRose Homework Help
          program and the Learning Center</strong>. Through AskRose, I assist students from elementary school through
        college via phone-based tutoring. At the Learning Center, I specialize in tutoring Rose-Hulman students in
        computer science and software engineering courses such as Data Structures & Algorithms, Web Programming, and
        Computer Architecture. I was recently promoted to <strong>Learning Center Supervisor</strong>, a role in which I
        serve as a liaison between tutoring staff, student visitors, and Learning Center administration.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also <strong>serve as a teaching assistant</strong> and grader for the CSSE department, where I help ensure
        fair and consistent grading while providing individualized academic support. Outside the classroom, I work at
        the campus eSports Center, where I help maintain a welcoming and inclusive environment and act as a
        communication bridge between students and campus administrators.
      </p>
      <p>
        My social involvement extends to both a service fraternity and a social fraternity ‚Äî Alpha Phi Omega and Pi
        Kappa Alpha, respectively. As <strong>Vice President of Service for APO</strong>, I coordinated service events
        for a chapter of approximately 50 members and was honored with the H2 Section's <em>Leader of Service</em>
        recognition. Within Pi Kappa Alpha, I have mentored three new members during their recruitment process, helping
        them grow through one of the most transformative periods of their lives. Mentorship has not only allowed me to
        support others but has also encouraged me to reflect on and refine my own character.
      </p>
      <p>
        These experiences have shaped me into a more empathetic, disciplined, and community-oriented individual. Whether
        I'm tutoring a student, mentoring a peer, or organizing a service event, I strive to lead with purpose and
        integrity. My time at Rose-Hulman has been defined not only by academic achievement, but by the relationships
        I've built and the lives I've had the privilege to impact.

      <h2>üîêüëÄ My Next Chapter: Cryptography & Cyber Defense</h2>
      <p>
        Looking ahead, <strong>I want to study cybersecurity after I complete my undergraduate studies</strong>.
        Specifically, I'm eager to deepen my understanding of cryptography, cyber threat intelligence, and application
        security‚Äîfields that are critical to protecting sensitive data and maintaining trust in digital systems. I'm
        particularly interested in how encryption algorithms safeguard communication, how threat intelligence helps
        anticipate and mitigate attacks, and how secure coding practices can prevent vulnerabilities in software. My
        goal is to contribute to building resilient systems that can withstand evolving cyber threats in both public and
        private sectors.
