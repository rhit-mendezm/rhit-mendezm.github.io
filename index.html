        <p>
          I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor's of Science in Software Engineering at Rose-Hulman
          Institute of Technology, where I've developed a strong foundation in software development
          and maintenance. So far, my favorite courses at Rose-Hulman are Web Programming (CSSE 280),
          Computer Architecture I (CSSE 232), and Software Quality Assurance (CSSE 376) because they
          each introduced me to a distinct area of software development I have not seen prior to taking
          the course.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Web programming introduced me to front-end development entirely. I learned about:
            <ul>
              <li>Client and server communication</li>
              <li>Prototyping with Figma</li>
              <li>Programming in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

          I've interned at <a href="https://www.kratosdefense.com"><strong>Kratos Defense & Security Solutions</strong></a>
          and <a href="https://www.rhventures.org"><strong>Rose-Hulman Ventures</strong></a>, so I have contributed to
          real world software projects in both defense and medical domains.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            At Kratos, I worked with the Software Architecture Team to develop middleware 
            involved in satellite communications.
          </li>
          <li>
            At Ventures, I developed software for a full-stack medical application that allowed 
            administrators to virtually certify that patients were following rehabilitation procedures.
          </li>
        </ul>

          Looking ahead, I want to study cybersecurity after I complete my undergraduate studies. Specifically, I want to 
          learn more about cryptography, cyber threat intelligence, and application security.
