          <ul>
            <li class="hide-list-style indent">
              <p>A recreation of the social media app <i>Fizz</i>. Catered for college students, <i>Fizz</i> is anonymous and moderated by other college students. In this project, we developed the frontend and backend based on <i>Fizz</i> with a focus on the database. Our development kept the main features such as posting, liking, commenting, anonymity, blocking, and tagging. This project was developed in a team of three over the span of four weeks for the Rose-Hulman course CSSE333 - Database Systems.</p>

        <li><h3>Betrayal at House on the Hill</h3>
          <ul>
            <li class="hide-list-style indent two-grid-boxes">
              <p>Based on the board game <i>Betrayal at House on the Hill</i>, this project was developed with a focus on software quality assurance which includes actions like test-driven development, mutation testing, path coverage, etc. In brief, the board game supports three to six players where the goal is to explore and escape from a mansion. After a certain point, the <u>haunt</u> event occurs, and one player becomes a traitor. The traitor's goal is to entrap the remaining players who are now known as heroes. Meanwhile, the heroes' goal is to escape the mansion. Our recreation of the board game provides a reduced feature set. For example, the traitor can hold over fifty different roles, and we implemented two roles. In a team of three over eight weeks, we developed this project for the Rose-Hulman course CSSE376 - Software Quality Assurance.</p>

        <li><h3>RISC-V Assembler</h3>
          <ul>
            <li class="hide-list-style indent">
              <p>This project assembles RISC-V code into machine code. The assembler supports most instructions of the RISC-V set excluding auipc, csrrw, csrrs, csrrc, ecall, and ebreak. It is capable of recognizing registers by their formal and informal names (x2 and sp for example), and it translates a collection of psuedoinstructions. I developed this project mainly alone in ten days for the Rose-Hulman course CSSE232 - Computer Architecture 1. Although, it is worth noting that some of the test cases were given by the CSSE faculty at Rose-Hulman.</p>
