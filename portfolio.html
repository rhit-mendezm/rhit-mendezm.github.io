      <h2>üíª Experience in Full-Stack Development and Tool Creation</h2>
      <p>
        During my undergraduate studies, I actively engaged in the development of full-stack applications and various
        software tools. The full-stack applications were primarily designed and implemented as part of academic
        projects. These projects often involved both front-end and back-end development, giving me hands-on experience
        with a wide range of technologies and frameworks.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to academic assignments, I also took the initiative to create tools for personal use. These
        tools were developed to streamline certain tasks, reflecting my ability to identify needs and build effective
        technical solutions independently. Furthermore, some of the tools were created as part of coursework,
        demonstrating my ability to meet project requirements and deliver functional software within academic
        constraints.
      </p>
      <p>
        A selection of these projects is showcased in my GitHub repository, which can be accessed via the footer link
        labeled <em>Marlon's GitHub</em>.
      </p>

      <h3>üíúüêù Social Media Platform Recreation - Inspired by <em>Fizz</em></h3>
      <p>
        As part of a four-week team project for the Rose-Hulman course <b>CSSE333 - Database Systems</b>,
        we developed a full-stack recreation of the social media application <em>Fizz</em>, a platform designed
        specifically for college students. Fizz is known for its anonymous posting features and peer
        moderation system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our team of three focused on replicating the core functionalities of the original app, including anonymous
        posting, liking, commenting, user blocking, and tagging. While we implemented both the frontend and backend
        components, particular emphasis was placed on designing and managing the database architecture to support these
        features efficiently and securely.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project provided valuable experience in collaborative development, database design, and the implementation
        of privacy-focused social media features. It was developed using <b>MySQL for database management</b>, along
        with
        <b>JavaScript and TypeScript for frontend and backend development</b>.
      </p>


      <h3>üè° Board Game Recreation - Betrayal at House on the Hill</h3>
      <p>
        This project is a software-based adaptation of the board game <em>Betrayal at House on the Hill</em>, developed
        as part of the Rose-Hulman course <b>CSSE376 - Software Quality Assurance</b>. During development, the primary
        focus was on applying rigorous software quality practices, including <b>test-driven development (TDD)</b>,
        <b>mutation
          testing</b>, and <b>path coverage analysis</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The original game supports three to six players who explore a haunted mansion until a pivotal event ‚Äî known as
        the <em>haunt</em> ‚Äî is triggered. At that point, one player becomes the traitor, whose objective is to defeat
        the remaining players, now referred to as heroes. The heroes, in turn, must work together to escape the mansion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our implementation concentrates on core mechanics. While the original game includes over fifty possible traitor
        roles, our version implements two, allowing us to focus on quality assurance and maintainability. The project
        was developed over eight weeks by a team of three using <b>Java for development</b> and
        <b>JUnit for testing</b>, emphasizing collaborative development and disciplined software assurance techniques.
      </p>


      <h3>‚öôÔ∏è RISC-V Assembler - Machine Instruction Translation Tool</h3>
      <p>
        This project involved the development of a custom assembler that converts <b>RISC-V assembly code</b> into
        machine code. Created for the Rose-Hulman course <b>CSSE232 - Computer Architecture I</b>, the assembler
        supports the majority of the RISC-V instruction set, excluding a few specialized instructions such as AUIPC,
        CSRRW, CSRRS, CSRRC, ECALL, and EBREAK.
      </p>
      <p>
        The assembler is designed to recognize both formal and informal register names (e.g., x2 and sp) and includes
        support for translating a variety of <b>pseudoinstructions</b> into their corresponding machine-level
        representations. This enhances usability while maintaining alignment with RISC-V standards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Developed in <b>Python</b>, the project was completed independently over a ten-day period. While the core
        implementation was self-directed, a subset of test cases was provided by the CSSE faculty. This project
        emphasized low-level systems programming, instruction encoding, and practical application of computer
        architecture concepts.
      </p>
