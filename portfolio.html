            <li class="hide-list-style indent">
              <p>A recreation of the social media app <i>Fizz</i>. Catered for college students, <i>Fizz</i> is
                anonymous
                and moderated by other college students. In this project, we developed the frontend and backend based on
                <i>Fizz</i> with a focus on the database. Our development kept the main features such as posting,
                liking,
                commenting, anonymity, blocking, and tagging. This project was developed in a team of three over the
                span
                of four weeks for the Rose-Hulman course CSSE333 - Database Systems.

                alt="Physical copy of the Betrayal at House on the Hill board game.">
              <p>Based on the board game <i>Betrayal at House on the Hill</i>, this project was developed with a focus
                on
                software quality assurance which includes actions like test-driven development, mutation testing, path
                coverage, etc. In brief, the board game supports three to six players where the goal is to explore and
                escape from a mansion. After a certain point, the <u>haunt</u> event occurs, and one player becomes a
                traitor. The traitor's goal is to entrap the remaining players who are now known as heroes. Meanwhile,
                the
                heroes' goal is to escape the mansion. Our recreation of the board game provides a reduced feature set.
                For example, the traitor can hold over fifty different roles, and we implemented two roles. In a team of
                three over eight weeks, we developed this project for the Rose-Hulman course CSSE376 - Software Quality
                Assurance.</p>

          <h3>RISC-V Assembler</h3>
          <ul>
            <li class="hide-list-style indent">
              <p>This project assembles RISC-V code into machine code. The assembler supports most instructions of the
                RISC-V set excluding auipc, csrrw, csrrs, csrrc, ecall, and ebreak. It is capable of recognizing
                registers
                by their formal and informal names (x2 and sp for example), and it translates a collection of
                psuedoinstructions. I developed this project mainly alone in ten days for the Rose-Hulman course CSSE232
                -
                Computer Architecture 1. Although, it is worth noting that some of the test cases were given by the CSSE
                faculty at Rose-Hulman.</p>
