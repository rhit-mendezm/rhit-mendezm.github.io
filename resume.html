    <section class="programming-languages">
      <p>
        Above is a list of my favorite programming languages. My coding journey began in middle school with Scratch, but
        I was first introduced to a "real" programming language Python during my freshman year at Rose-Hulman. While
        Python was my starting point, Java has become my favorite. Through Java, I explored key software design
        principles like encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and SOLID principles such as the Open/Closed Principle,
        Dependency Inversion, and Single Responsibility Principle. These concepts deepened my appreciation for clean and
        maintainable code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond Java and Python, I've also worked with Shell, SQL, and C. I used Shell scripting to automate repetitive
        tasks and streamline my personal workflows, which has helped me appreciate the power of command-line tools. With
        SQL, I've designed and queried relational databases, gaining a solid understanding of data modeling and
        integrity. My experience with C has been particularly valuable for learning about low-level programming and
        memory management. In the upcoming
        winter term, I'll be deepening my knowledge of C when I take the Operating Systems course.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although not listed here, I'm also familiar with HTML and CSS. While HTML is technically a language (it's in the
        name ‚Äî HyperText Markup <em>Language</em>), I chose to omit it along with CSS because they're relatively
        straightforward to learn. That said, I recognize the design challenges in front-end development that highlight
        their power. For example, using semantic HTML elements, avoiding inline styles in favor of CSS files,
        centralizing shared values in the root element, and organizing the DOM for clean, readable JavaScript all
        contribute to robust and scalable front-end systems. I encountered many of these design considerations firsthand
        while building this website, which gave me a deeper appreciation for thoughtful front-end architecture!

      <h2>üêß My Linux Journey: From Shell Commands to Neovim</h2>
      <p>
        I began working with Linux in 2024, and I am familiar with common Shell commands like grep, less, cut, etc. and
        the redirection and pipe operators. Since then, I have configured my Neovim setup to edit files, so I would say
        my favorite text editor is Neovim, but my favorite IDE is VSCode. Regarding Linux distributions, I am most
        familiar with Ubuntu and AlmaLinux.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the future, I want to learn more about the permissions aspect inside a Linux environment, so I hope to
        obtain a work experience that allows me to explore that area of Linux at some point!

        </li>

        <li>Migrated an outdated system to ASP.NET using C# and updated a scalable SQL database to manage patient records</li>
        <li>Spearheaded the adoption of the xUnit testing framework to automatically unit test code</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
         I began working with Rose-Hulman Ventures during the Winter Quarter of my third year - stepping into my first formal software
         engineering role. Balancing a full academic course load and extracurricular commitments, I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect, but I 
         quickly found myself in a supportive environment that encouraged growth and learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of my key contributions was engineering a full-stack medical web application,
        <a href="https://www.rhventures.org/remote-medication-monitoring-app/" target="_blank"><strong>eRAMx</strong></a>,
        designed to support thousands of patients on their journey to sobriety. I migrated an outdated system to the ASP.NET
        framework using C# and managed a SQL database to manage extensive patient records. These technical efforts helped improve
        the reliability and accessibility of the platform for both patients and medical professionals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond development, I spearheaded the adoption of the xUnit testing framework - laying the groundwork for automated unit testing 
        and improving code quality across the project. Working closely with a team of developers, I also honed my communication skills,
        embraced best practices like incremental commits and pull requests, and learned to articulate my code decisions during reviews.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking back, my time at Ventures was more than just a technical internship; it was a formative experience that taught me how to
        stay mission-driven, navigate ambiguity, and find purpose in the details. I plan to return in the Fall, but the lessons I‚Äôve
        learned will stay with me well beyond graduation.

      <h2>üßë‚Äçüéì Education Experience</h2>

      <h3>Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology</h3>
      <p class="date-range">August 2022 - May 2026</p>
      <ul>
        <li>B.S. of Software Engineering</li>
        <li>Minor in Spanish</li>
        <li><strong>GPA:</strong> 3.51/4.00</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Rose-Hulman was more than just my first step into college ‚Äî it was my first real leap into independence. Ten
        hours
        from home, I arrived in the fall of 2022 with more energy than direction, greeting everyone I passed ‚Äî students,
        professors, even the folks in the cafeteria.
      </p>
      <p>
        Somewhere between group projects, late-night brainstorming, and spontaneous hallway conversations, I found my
        people. Friends who challenged me, inspired me, and shared a belief in constant self-improvement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, in 2025, I'm heading into my final year with a deep sense of growth. I've evolved ‚Äî personally and
        professionally ‚Äî and I'm especially proud of the opportunity I've had to mentor the young men who were willing
        to take a chance on me. Their trust has been one of the most meaningful parts of my journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        Saying goodbye to close friends will be a bittersweet moment ‚Äî one that leaves a noticeable void in the rhythm
        of daily life. Still, I carry confidence in the foundation we've built at Rose. Whether the challenges ahead are
        technical or personal, I believe we're well-equipped to meet them with resilience and purpose.
