        Below is a list of programming languages I am proficient in coding. I list them in order from most favorite
        to least favorite. I first learned about coding with scratch in middle school, and the first "real"
        programming language I learned was Python during my freshman year at Rose-Hulman. However, Java is my favorite
        language because I learned about design concepts like encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance,
        Open/Closed Principle, Dependency Inversion Principle, Single Responsibility Principle, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't list them here, but I am familiar with HTML and CSS programming. In my eyes, HTML is technically a
        language since it has language in the name (HyperText Markup <em>Language</em>), but it's not a challenging
        language to learn, so I omit it from my list. Likewise, CSS is simple to learn, too, so I don't list it either.
        I think the design challenges faced in front end programming highlight the power of these two languages, though.
        To list a few, the HTML elements should be used for their semantic meanings, inline styling should be avoided
        and written in CSS files, the root element should contain any shared values to avoid "duplicate code" in style
        sheets, and the DOM should be organized in a manner that allows for simple JavaScript code to read and
        manipulate it.
      </p>

      <h2>Software Languages</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>☕ Java</li>
        <li>🐍 Python</li>
        <li>🌐 JavaScript</li>
        <li>🐚 Shell</li>
        <li>🗃️ SQL</li>
        <li>🔧 C</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Systems</h2>
      <p>
        I began working with Linux in 2024, and I am familiar with common Shell commands like grep, less, cut, etc. and
        the redirection and pipe operators. Since then, I have configured my Neovim setup to edit files, so I would say
        my favorite text editor is Neovim, but my favorite IDE is VSCode. Regarding Linux distributions, I am most
        familiar with Ubuntu and AlmaLinux.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the future, I want to learn more about the permissions aspect inside a Linux environment, so I hope to
        obtain a work experience that allows me to explore that area of Linux at some point!
