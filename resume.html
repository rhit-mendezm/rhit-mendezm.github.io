        Below is a list of programming languages I am proficient in coding. I list them in order from most favorite
        to least favorite. I first learned about coding with scratch in middle school, and the first "real"
        programming language I learned was Python during my freshman year at Rose-Hulman. However, Java is my favorite
        language because I learned about design concepts like encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance,
        Open/Closed Principle, Dependency Inversion Principle, Single Responsibility Principle, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't list them here, but I am familiar with HTML and CSS programming. In my eyes, HTML is technically a
        language
        since it has language in the name (HyperText Markup <em>Language</em>), but it's not a challenging language to
        learn,
        so I omit it from my list. Likewise, CSS is simple to learn, too, so I don't list it either. I think the design
        challenges faced in front end programming highlight the power of these two languages, though. To list a few, the
        HTML
        elements should be used for their semantic meanings, inline styling should be avoided and typed in css files,
        the
        root element should contian any shared values to avoid "duplicate code" in style sheets, and the DOM should be
        organized in a manner that allows for simple JavaScript code to read and manipulate it.
      </p>

      <h2>Software Languages</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>☕ Java</li>
        <li>🐍 Python</li>
        <li>🌐 JavaScript</li>
        <li>🐚 Shell</li>
        <li>🗃️ SQL</li>
        <li>🔧 C</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Systems</h2>
      <p>
        I began working with Linux in 2024, and I am familiar with commom Shell commands like grep, less, cut, etc. and
        the redirection and pipe operators. Since then, I have configured my neovim setup to edit files, so I would say my
        favorite text editor is neovim, but my favorite IDE is VSCode. Regarding Linux distributions, I am most familiar with
        Ubuntu and Almalinux.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the future, I want to learn more about the permissions aspect of Linux, so I hope to obtain a work experience that 
        allows me to explore that area of Linux at some point! 
      </p>
