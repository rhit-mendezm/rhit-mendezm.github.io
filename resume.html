        Below is a list of programming languages I am proficient in coding. I list them in order from most favorite
        to least favorite. I first learned about coding with scratch in middle school, and the first "real"
        programming language I learned was Python during my freshman year at Rose-Hulman. However, Java is my favorite
        language because I learned about design concepts like encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance,
        Open/Closed Principle, Dependency Inversion Principle, Single Responsibility Principle, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't list them here, but I am familiar with HTML and CSS programming. In my eyes, HTML is technically a
        language since it has language in the name (HyperText Markup <em>Language</em>), but it's not a challenging
        language to learn, so I omit it from my list. Likewise, CSS is simple to learn, too, so I don't list it either.
        I think the design challenges faced in front end programming highlight the power of these two languages, though.
        To list a few, the HTML elements should be used for their semantic meanings, inline styling should be avoided
        and written in CSS files, the root element should contain any shared values to avoid "duplicate code" in style
        sheets, and the DOM should be organized in a manner that allows for simple JavaScript code to read and
        manipulate it.
      </p>

      <h2>Systems</h2>
      <p>
        I began working with Linux in 2024, and I am familiar with common Shell commands like grep, less, cut, etc. and
        the redirection and pipe operators. Since then, I have configured my Neovim setup to edit files, so I would say
        my favorite text editor is Neovim, but my favorite IDE is VSCode. Regarding Linux distributions, I am most
        familiar with Ubuntu and AlmaLinux.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the future, I want to learn more about the permissions aspect inside a Linux environment, so I hope to
        obtain a work experience that allows me to explore that area of Linux at some point!

        <li>Collaborated with a team of 4</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I began working with Rose-Hulman Ventures during the Winter Quarter of my third year. With no prior experience
        in a formal software engineering role, I wasn't entirely sure what to expect ‚Äî especially while balancing the
        demands of a full academic course load and extracurricular commitments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite my initial nerves, I was welcomed into a supportive and understanding environment. The Ventures team,
        particularly our managers, recognized the unique challenges of being a student intern and provided the
        flexibility and guidance I needed to succeed. During my time there, I honed my communication skills, adopted
        best practices like frequent and incremental commits, and became comfortable working on feature branches,
        submitting pull requests, and articulating my code changes for review.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an intern working 8 to 10 hours per week, I occasionally questioned the impact of my contributions. This was
        my first encounter with a non-technical challenge: losing sight of the broader purpose behind the code. Our
        project, eRAMx, is designed to support individuals on their path to sobriety by enabling virtual check-ins with
        medical professionals. My managers were instrumental in reconnecting me with that mission, helping me see how
        even small technical contributions could have meaningful real-world effects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking back, my experience at Ventures was more than just a technical internship ‚Äî it was a formative chapter
        in my growth as a developer and a teammate. It taught me how to navigate ambiguity, stay mission-driven, and
        find purpose in the details. I plan to return in the Fall, but these are lessons I'll carry with me well beyond
        graduation.
      </p>

      <h2>Education Experience</h2>

      <h3>Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology</h3>
      <p class="data-range">August 2022 - May 2026</p>
      <ul>
        <li>B.S. of Software Engineering</li>
        <li>Minor in Spanish</li>
        <li><b>GPA:</b> 3.51/4.00</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Rose-Hulman was more than just my first step into college ‚Äî it was my first real leap into independence. Ten
        hours
        from home, I arrived in the fall of 2022 with more energy than direction, greeting everyone I passed ‚Äî students,
        professors, even the folks in the cafeteria.
      </p>
      <p>
        Somewhere between group projects, late-night brainstorming, and spontaneous hallway conversations, I found my
        people. Friends who challenged me, inspired me, and shared a belief in constant self-improvement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, in 2025, I'm heading into my final year with a deep sense of growth. I've evolved ‚Äî personally and
        professionally ‚Äî and I'm especially proud of the opportunity I've had to mentor the young men who were willing
        to take a chance on me. Their trust has been one of the most meaningful parts of my journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        Saying goodbye to close friends will be a bittersweet moment ‚Äî one that leaves a noticeable void in the rhythm
        of daily life. Still, I carry confidence in the foundation we've built at Rose. Whether the challenges ahead are
        technical or personal, I believe we're well-equipped to meet them with resilience and purpose.
      </p>
